# Tadpole

A simulation where Tadpoles fight for food on a 2d grid. Each generation of Tadpoles is born with unique traits, some being more beneficial to survival. Tadpoles who survive longer have a higher chance to breed the next generation of Tadpoles, forming a genetic-optimization through simulation.

Yes, Tadpoles turn into frogs before reproducing, please ignore the plot hole.
